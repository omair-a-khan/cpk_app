# Process Capability Index Calculator

An online tool for calculating the confidence interval of $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$ or its lower bound inverse is available at \url{https://westelastomer.shinyapps.io/pci_confidence}. A screenshot of the app is shown in Figure 1. The user can specify whether they want to input the measured PCI (output: $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval) or the desired PCI (output: lower confidence bound for which the process will be capable $100(1-\alpha)\%$ of the time). The second option also produces a plot of the inverse function and a searchable table of values.
