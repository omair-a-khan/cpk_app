# Process Capability Index Calculator

An online tool for calculating the confidence interval of Cp and Cpk or its lower bound inverse is available at https://omairadilkhan.shinyapps.io/cpk_app. The user can specify whether they want to input the measured PCI (output: 100(1-\alpha)% confidence interval) or the desired PCI (output: lower confidence bound for which the process will be capable 100(1-\alpha)% of the time). The second option also produces a plot of the inverse function and a searchable table of values. The application will load in any modern browser (including Internet Explorer 9). The tool was developed using Shiny, a web application framework for R.
